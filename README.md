# Dawn of the New Paint
![](/ScreenShots/screenshot1.png?raw=true "Ooooh such theme much featurez.")
## Remarks
- A paint program based on the *Tales of Symphonia* games of the **Tales of** franchise (creds to them for the theme)
- Everything else is written from scratch using Python 2.7 and Pygame
- Colors are taken from an opaque `colours.pyc` file, which exposes a number of variables that map to rgba colour constants

## Features
- Very "nicely" designed UI with lots of helpful messages and indicators
- Super awesome theme :DD
- /10/ different tools to use with variable tool-sizes, including a fillbucket, brush, eraser and spray can
- Custom mouse icons for tools
- **Layer support**, with scroll-bar on the right for too many layers !
- Layer manipulation (add, move, delete, rename) support
- 10 stamps of your favorite Tales of Symphonia characters
- A nice colour palette with a greyscale bar
- *Moveable toolbar*!
- Save and Load functions
- **Undo** and **Redo** features (which support all operations, including those on layers!)
- Lots'o shortcut keyz
- GLITCHES (they're features dangit)

## Building and Running
Requirements: Python 2.7 and corresponding Pygame
1) Run `Dawn of the New Paint.py` using Python (Idle also works)
2) Play around.
3) Alternatively, you can download a `.exe` "compiled" version of the app from [Here](http://www.mediafire.com/file/vdng7h892hvb81w/Dawn_of_the_New_Paint.rar), which was generated using `Py2Exe` - Just extract and run `Dawn of the New Paint.exe`
